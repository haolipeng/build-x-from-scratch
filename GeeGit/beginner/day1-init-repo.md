ll the data for a Git repository — from its commit history to its configuration — lives inside a hidden folder called `.git`. It’s created when you initialize a new repository with `git init`. In this stage, you’ll implement that command yourself.

⚠️ Complete repository setup to see the code you need to uncomment.

2

Git push to submit your changes

First, run this command to commit your changes:

command line

```
git commit -am "[any message]"
```
